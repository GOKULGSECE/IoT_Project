# Wearable IoT Device for Sewage Cleaners

## Introduction
This repository contains documentation for a wearable IoT device designed specifically for sewage cleaners. The device is equipped with sensors to monitor harmful gases present in sewage environments and communicates this data to the Blynk app, providing real-time alerts and monitoring capabilities.

## Features
- **Gas Monitoring**: Utilizes sensors to detect harmful gases commonly found in sewage environments, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3).
- **Real-time Alerts**: Sends immediate alerts to the Blynk app when hazardous gas levels are detected, ensuring the safety of the wearer.
- **Data Logging**: Records gas concentration levels over time, allowing for historical analysis and trend monitoring.
- **Wearable Design**: Compact and lightweight design intended for comfortable wear during sewage cleaning tasks.

## Installation
As this is a hardware project, no direct installation steps are provided in this repository. However, you can refer to the hardware assembly guide provided in the documentation folder for instructions on how to assemble the wearable IoT device.

## Usage
1. **Wear Device**: Ensure the wearable IoT device is securely worn before entering sewage environments.
2. **Monitor Data**: Open the Blynk app on your smartphone to monitor real-time gas concentration levels. 
3. **Respond to Alerts**: Take appropriate safety measures if hazardous gas levels exceed safety thresholds. Exit the area immediately if necessary.
